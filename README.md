# Object Compare

Compare object properties set in JSON or YAML. Unlike string comparison/diff tools, it will not report differences in property order.


## Development mode

Start live reloading development environment:

```bash
$ npm i
$ npm start
```

Then open `localhost:8000` in your browser.

CSS live reloads. HTML and JavaScript changes require a browser refresh.

Settings can be changed in `env.dev`.


## Production build

Create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```
